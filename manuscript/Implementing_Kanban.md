-# Implementing Kanban

React, even though a young library, has made a significant impact on the front-end development community. It introduced concepts, such as the virtual DOM, and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for the web. But React isn't limited to the web. You can use it to develop mobile and even terminal user interfaces.

In this part, we will implement a small Kanban application. During the process, you will learn the basics of React. As React is just a view library we will also discuss supporting technology. Alt, a Flux framework, provides a good companion to React and allows you to keep your components clean. You will also see how to use React DnD to add drag and drop functionality to the Kanban board.

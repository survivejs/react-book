# SurviveJS - Webpack and React

<img align="right" width="255" height="329" src="manuscript/images/title_page_small.png" />

> **IMPORTANT!** If you want to support the development of this book, you can [purchase a copy at Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack). There's also [a paperback available through Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/SurviveJS-Webpack-React-apprentice-master/dp/152391050X/).

Webpack, a module bundler, solves a significant problem for web developers. It can be daunting to learn but once you grok it, life gets easier. Same goes for React, a JavaScript library for building UIs. This book shows you how to build a little Kanban application using these technologies. During the process you will learn the basics and will be able to take the skills to your own projects.

## How to Use This Repository?

The repository has been split in two main parts: `manuscript` and `project_source`. You can find the freely available chapters under `manuscript` organized per chapter. `project_source` contains source associated to each chapter.

There is no single right way to approach the book. It depends on your experience level and interest. You can build the project from scratch by following the book or you can start from a specific stage. Just pick the source from previous chapter as your starting point.

Please note that the repository defaults to the `dev` branch of the book. `master` contains the source of the most recent version. Each version has been tagged so that it's easy for you to find the source matching to the version of the book you are reading.
